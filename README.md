I've been diving into the tech industry for a solid 12 years now. My journey has taken me through the exciting realms of DevOps, Cloud, and System Engineering. I take pride in my ability to implement and maintain robust cloud infrastructure and build efficient automated deployment pipelines using Kubernetes, GCP, AWS, and a variety of CI/CD tools.

Staying on top of the latest trends and best practices in cloud computing is my jam. The tech landscape is ever-evolving, and I'm constantly on the lookout for opportunities to learn and grow. Beyond the lines of code, I'm deeply passionate about giving back to the community through volunteering and mentorship.

If you're curious about my take on cloud technology, swing by my personal blog, 'Geek in the Cloud,' at geekinthecloud.xyz. You might also catch me sharing insights at industry events.
