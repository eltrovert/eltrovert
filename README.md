If this is your first time here, Here some brief introduction about my self. 

I've been diving into the tech industry for a solid 12 years now. My journey has taken me through the exciting realms of Customer and Technical Support, System Administrator and Engineer, and I'm currently in the exciting journey in Infrastructure Architecting world. I take pride in my ability to :
- Implement and maintain robust cloud infrastructure
- Build efficient automated deployment pipelines using variety of CI/CD tools integrating multiple deployment and testing strategy in the GitOps process.
- Manage and utilise cloud native and opensource tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, Vault, FluxCD, etc.

Staying on top of the latest trends and best practices in cloud computing is my jam. The tech landscape is ever-evolving, and I'm constantly on the lookout for opportunities to learn and grow. Beyond the lines of code, I'm deeply passionate about giving back to the community through volunteering and mentorship.
